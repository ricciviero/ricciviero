## Hi, Iâ€™m Riccardo ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 26-year-old passionate about all things tech. After spending several years in marketing, I recently made the leap into development, with a primary focus on front-end technologies. Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of frameworks like React, Flutter, Angular, and React Native, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to push myself further.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and building new projects to sharpen my skills.
ðŸ’¡ Open to collaborations, ideas, and opportunities in the tech space.
